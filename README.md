This is a skeleton for your project work in BTI 7071.

It includes a code template with a build system and grading
automation.

Run "make" to build the assignment PDFs and your code.

Commit your code via "git push" for submission and grading. You may
submit as often as you wish -- before the deadline.

You must edit the provided main C files to implement
the project.

You may make adjustments to the build system, as long as
the generated binaries have the prescribed names.

You should not touch the CI itself.
